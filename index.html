                <div class="sub-container">
                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p id="bio">Daniel Offei is an aspiring back-end software engineer and emerging tech talent currently undergoing intensive training at <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALX</a>, with a mission to build innovative, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. I am also the founder of <strong>DannyTechStudio</strong>, a growing personal brand focused on building intuitive and functional digital products.</p>
                    <p>I have built several practical applications including a portfolio and business website for a computer hardware and technical support business, a password analyzer app, a budget calculator, and both basic and scientific calculators, showcasing my strong foundation in front-end development, logic structuring, and user-focused design. I hold certifications in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp</a>, which have strengthened my technical capabilities and problem-solving approach.</p>
                    <p>With a strong foundation in leadership and design, I have led multiple high-performing teams—from having my team’s building floor plan project selected and sold to a client during high school, to leading a team of 6 at ALX to identify and design a digital solution addressing youth unemployment, demonstrating my drive to apply tech for social impact.</p>
                    <p>I aspires to acquire skills in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and AWS DevOps in the near future, combining deep technical expertise with visionary leadership to create tools that empower people and transform systems.</p>

                    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                    <p id="elevator-pitch">Daniel Offei is an aspiring backend software engineer currently enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering program. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through creative digital solutions and continuously improving by learning new technologies. </p> 
                    <p>I naturally gravitate toward leadership and collaboration in team environments.
                        In high school, I studied Building Construction and had my ground floor plan chosen as the best out of 40 students—later sold to a client. I also led a team of six in a full building project presentation, earning recognition as the best-performing group. After school, I joined a sanitary products company, where I led a logistics team of seven. Through our consistent high performance, we boosted the company’s distribution efficiency by 35%.
                        Also at ALX, I led a team of six in researching and designing a solution to tackle youth unemployment—a global issue—showcasing my ability to merge technical thinking with real-world impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>My top skills include effective communication, problem-solving, team leadership, and creative thinking. What makes me stand out is my ability to lead, adapt, and deliver results.</p>
                    <p>In the near future, I plan to advance my career by specializing in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and earning AWS DevOps certification, so I can help companies build smart, scalable, and future-ready systems.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking for a dedicated, forward-thinking team player ready to grow and add value, I’d love the opportunity to connect.</p>
